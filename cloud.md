> ## What is Cloud Computing?

According to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
    
- Cloud Computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to shared pool of configurable computing resources (eg. networks, servers, storage, application and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management efforts or service provider interaction.
- It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage and access data online rather than local drives.
- It is named as such because applications can be placed on a cloud of master system.
- Cloud refers to a network on internet where data is stored in centrally located web server.
- Its a technology where data is stored, configured and manipulated in a remote location with security.

> ## What are the features of Cloud Computing?
- Resource pooling
- On-demand self service
- Easy maintenance
- Large/Broad Network Access
- High Availability and Resiliency
- Economical
- High Security
- Pay as you go
- Measured services & Reporting service
- Scalability & Rapid Elasticity
- Automation & Disaster Recovery

> ## *Deployment Models in Cloud Computing*

1. Public:
- A model where service provider makes resources such as applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet.
    
2. Private: (Internal/Corporate cloud)
- Cloud computing properties are enabled in a company internal data centre. It provides an isolated portion of cloud made accessible to only one customer. (on-premise outsourced)
    
3. Community:
- IT resources are required by all collaborating partners are offered in a controlled environment accessible only by the community of companies that generally trust each other and uses same resources.
    
4. Hybrid:
- Any combination of public, private and community resources interconnected using VPN. In the hybrid model a company can use primary essential resources (such as databases) on it's on premises and uses public resources (i.e. websites) on the third party public cloud.

`Organisation Managed services`

`Cloud Provider / vendor Managed services.`

used by

- IaaS: Infrastructure & Network Architects
        (servers storage, Network)
- PaaS: Used by Application Developers
        (O/S & Application stack, server, storage, Network)
- SaaS: Used by End Users.
        (package software, OS, Application stack, Servers, storage, Network)

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):

        It deals with-
        - Physical and virtual computers on servers.
        - Storage such as hard disks.
        - Network

It is mainly used by research and computing users.

It is preferable when we have software and required platform ready.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS):
- It is generally used by developers and deployers. Developers make use of this service to rent tools from vendors.

eg. Database, Operating System, Middleware, Networks, Servers and Storage etc.
    
3. Software as a Service (SaaS):
- It is a software service. Customer consumes the product built by service provider. Its a subscription-based model.
- Software is generally hosted on cloud and accessed using the internet.

eg. Online Dictionary

> Benefits of SaaS:

Zero hardware cost, No initial setup required, Automatic updates available, Customized application functionality, could be accessed from anywhere, Auto-patching done by service provider, Disaster recovery mechanism, and cost saving.


> ## Cloud Architecture

Front End:

The front End is used by the client. It contains client side interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platforms.

The front end is visible to clients and it contains web servers, browsers, client network and other devices. It is connected to back end through the internet.

Back End:

The back end is used by service provider. It manages all the resources that are required to provide cloud computing service. It includes huge amount of data storage, security mechanism, virtual machines, deploying models, Servers, traffic control mechanisms and other important services.

> ## Benifits of Cloud Computing

1. Cloud service providers must provide data privacy. The term GDPR refers to General Data Protection Regulation.
2. Customers Centric Approach.
3. Work from anywhere.
4. It provides latest technology to the customers.
5. Significant financial savings.
6. 24Ã—7 support.
7. It has device & location independent services.
8. Wide range of services.

> ## Essential characteristics or Attributes of Cloud Computing
1) Security :

Cloud services are packed with both in built & add on data protection features. Security in broader perspective refers to-
    
    a) Disaster Recovery
    b) Identity & Access Management.
    c) Compliance
    d) Governance

2) On-Demand self services:

It is readymade and customizable. Cloud Services are ready to use and catered according to clients need and is simple and friendly.

3) Multi-sharing / Resource Pooling:

Cloud follows multi-tenant architecture eg. Browsing Centre, where each system is shared among customers but have things in common like space, network, printer, etc

4) Easy Maintenance :

Down time is reduced by a large extent.

5)Low Cost:

It minimizes infrastructure cost, platform cost and service cost.

Subscription model comes into picture. (Monthly, quarterly & yearly.) Pay as you go model.

6) Measured services:

It can be easily related to electricity meters at our homes. Resources are metered and monitored. It follows pay what you use.

7) Broader network access:

Cloud supports diverse platform for catering the services to the customers. Internet allows any thin or thick client eg. laptop, mobile or a phone to access services through standard mechanism.

8) Reliability:

It can be measured in terms of percentage.

9) Availability:

Reliability focuses on how often service gets interrupted on other hand availability counts on the recovery time during failure.

10) Elasticity:

Capabilities can be made flexible based on the application needs. Capabilities can be both elastically and automatically provisioned and release to scale rapidly with demand.

> ## SLA: Service Level Agreement
It is the agreement signed between service provider and the customers.

> ## Disaster recovery plans

Preventive measures:
Preventive events from occurring.

Detective measures:
Aiming at detecting unwanted events.

Corrective measures:
Aiming to correcting the system after recovery.

> ## Virtualization

Virtualization is the concept of creating logical computing resources (such as multiple servers) from limited physical resources (such as single physical server hardware available) with the help of virtualization tools like hypervisors, VMware, hyperV.
